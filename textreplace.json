  "windows": "Have you heard of the new dangerous computer virus? It's called \"Windows\", it was developed by the hacker group \"Microsoft\". This new virus is extremely dangerous. It installs bloatware on your PC that slows down your CPU and uses about half of your RAM, it also installs dangerous spyware that tracks everything you do on your system. But the worst part is, that you have to pay a random company 100$ just to be able to customize your system again and another couple 100$ to use your office programs. There are many different versions of the Windows virus. Its most common version is called \"Windows 11\". The reason Windows is so dangerous is that people who know almost nothing about tech don't even know if their PC is infected with proprietary bloatware. A really big problem with Windows is that it backdoors your PC, so a lot of other viruses will be able to infect your machine. The only way to prevent that is by installing another virus, like Avast. You may ask yourself how you know if Windows has Infected your PC, but there is a very easy test that everyone can do. Just ask yourself the question witch OS do I use? If the answer is \"I don't know\" your PC is probably infected with Windows If your PC is infected with Windows, the only thing you can do is to wipe your hard drive and install a FOSS operating system. We highly recommend that anyway. So remember kids: stay safe, use FOSS!",
  "matrix": "I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Element, is in fact, Matrix + Element, or as I've recently taken to calling it, Matrix plus Element. Element is not a messenger unto itself, but rather another free client of a fully functioning Matrix protocol made useful by the HTTP APIs, SDKs and VoIP comprising a full client as defined by the Matrix protocol. Many messenger users run a modified version of the Matrix protocol every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Matrix which is widely used today is often called Element, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Matrix protocol, developed by the Matrix Foundation. There really is a Element, and these people are using it, but it is just a client of the messaging protocol they use. Element is the client: the client of the protocol that sends the messages to the other people you talk to. The client is an essential part of an messaging protocol, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete messaging protocol. Element is normally used in combination with the Matrix messaging protocol: the whole protocol is basically Matrix with Element on it, or Matrix/Element. All the so-called Element clients are really clients of Matrix protocol!",
